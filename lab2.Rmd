```

1.Use R to demonstrate that the mean minimizes the sum of the squared deviations from the mean. Accomplish the following steps:
  Produce a sample of at least 10 or more different numbers
Produce a simulation following the example from the concepts section
Use your simulation to test a range of numbers smaller and larger than the mean to show that the mean minimizes the sum of the squared deviations from the mean.
Plot your results.



```{r}

1+1
```


```{r}
gapminder_data <- read.table("open_data/gapminder.csv", 
                             sep = ",",
                             header = TRUE )
```



```{r}
mean(gapminder_data$lifeExp)
```

sum(1:3)
